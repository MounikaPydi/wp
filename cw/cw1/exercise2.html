    <h1>Exercise 2 - Fixing a Deliberate Mistake</h1>
    <!-- <div class="fix-mistake">
        <p> The mistake in the provided code is: The `text-align: justify;` rule should be applied to paragraphs (`p`) instead of `body`.</p>
    </div> -->
    <div class="fix-mistake">
        The mistake in the original CSS code was the use of <span class="highlight">`text-indent: 2cm;`</span> for the paragraph.  <span class="highlight">`cm`</span> stands for centimeters, which is a very large unit of measurement for text indentation.  This would result in an excessively large indent.  A more appropriate unit for text indentation is <span class="highlight">`em`</span>, which is relative to the font size. The code has been corrected to use <span class="highlight">`text-indent: 2em;`</span> for a more typical and visually appealing indent.
